PRIVACY POLICY
This app stores very minimal information. It keeps track of your local high score for both classic and precision mode,
as well as your initials that you set upon starting the game for the first time.

There are two online leaderboards, both of which are only accessed with your name and score if you reach the top 10.
Even so, no affiliation to any personal information that you haven't already given to the game (your initials) will be
accessed in any way. No locations, no camera roll, no microphone, nothing else at all.

If required, you may contact me to delete information from the leaderboards at any time by emailing your request to
egglamation@gmail.com. For all other enrquiries, please also email me at egglamation@gmail.com
